* org-du

This Python 3 script parses parses a list of Org-mode files and
generates output similar to [[du][du]] (disk usage) but with lines of
Org-mode instead of kilobytes.

The purpose of this script is to use its output as the input for [[https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/XDU][xdu]]
in order to get an interactive graphical visualization:

: org-du.py my_org_file.org another_org_file.org | xdu

The script accepts an arbitrary number of files (see your shell for
possible length limitations).

** Why

GNU/Emacs Org-mode does a great job for outlining (collapsing and
expanding). However, when you want to get a brief overview on the
amount of content of each heading (e.g., to locate performance
optimization possibilities), you need a different tool: org-du

** Installation

Get it via [[https://github.com/novoid/org-du][GitHub]] or install it via [[https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/][pip]]: ~pip install org-du~

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :wrap src
org-du.py --help
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_src
usage: org-du.py [-h] [-v | --quiet | --version] file [file ...]

org-du parses a list of Org-mode files and generates
output similar to "du" (disk usage) but with lines
of Org-mode instead of kilobytes.

positional arguments:
  file           a list of file names

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose
  --quiet
  --version      show program's version number and exit

** Example

If you apply =org-du= to this =README.org= file, you will see
following visualization:

: org-du.py README.org

[[file:xdu-screenshot.png]]

You can /interactively navigate/ through sub-headings using your mouse.
Navigate back by clicking on the leftmost item of the visual tree.
Exit with =q=.

-------------------

Another cool usage scenario is when you invoke =org-du= on one host
(Windows) and visualizing is done on a different host. This can easily
be accomplished by re-directing the output of the script:

Host A (Windows):
: org-du.py *.org > org-du-output.txt

Then copying the file =org-du-output.txt= from host A to host B.

Host B (GNU/Linux):
: xdu < org-du-output.txt
